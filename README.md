# Welcome To Calisthenics

## How To Contribute On GitHub
1. Create an issue in this repository or select an existing issue
2. Comment on the issue that you would like to work on it
3. Once you have been assigned the issue, fork to the repository into a branch containing the issue number
4. When you are ready, submit a pull request from this branch
5. Your code will be reviewed and then either be approved or have changes requested
6. Once the pull request has been approved, you can safely delete your branch and start on a new issue.

Feel free to use your issue thread to communicate. Contributors will only be assigned one issue at a time. I'll assign myself multiple issues just because some of them can only be done by me.

## Contributor Incentives

Contributors who make an average of 1 pull request or more per month will be given a desk in a [virtual office building](https://gather.town). This will allow you to interact with other contributors while you work or just talk and play online mini games. An invite will be sent after your first contribution. From there, if you don't make a contribution for at least 2 months in a row, the invite will be revoked. But if you make another contribution, the invite will be sent again.

Although not gauranteed, if I get to the point where this or other apps allow me to hire an employee, contributors will be considered first. I do not care about college degrees.
